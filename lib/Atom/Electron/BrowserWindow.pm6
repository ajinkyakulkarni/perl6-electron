=begin pod
  Registers an event that the document changed its title

  Emitted when the window is going to be closed. It's emitted before the
  beforeunload and unload event of DOM, calling $event.prevent-default
  would cancel the close.

  Usually you would want to use the beforeunload handler to decide whether
  the window should be closed, which will also be called when the window
  is reloaded. In Electron, returning an empty string or false would cancel
  the close. An example is:

  window.onbeforeunload = sub($e) {
    say 'I do not want to be closed';

    # Unlike usual browsers, in which a string should be returned and the user is
    # prompted to confirm the page unload, Electron gives developers more options.
    # Returning empty string or false would prevent the unloading now.
    # You can also use the dialog API to let the user confirm closing the application.
    return False;
